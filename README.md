This code is in desperate need of refactoring. You will probably need to understand python to get it working.

Please check and edit the prompts.py file.

The requirements.txt may be out of date.

You will probably need a lot of VRAM to get good results. I've been using nous-hermes-2-solar-10.7b.Q5_K_M.gguf, but there may be something better out there now.

Please feel free to contribute and open pull requests.
